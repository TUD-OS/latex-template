GNU diction and style are free implementations of old standard unix
commands, that are not available on many modern systems, because they
have been unbundled.  Diction prints wordy and commonly misused phrases.
Style analyses surface characteristics of a document, e.g. sentence
length and various readability measures, but unlike the original code,
it lacks sentence type, word usage and most sentence beginning processing.

Both commands support English and German documents.
