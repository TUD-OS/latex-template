.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
\fBDiction\fP finds all sentences in a document, that contain phrases
from a database of frequently misused, bad or wordy diction.  It further
checks for double words.  If no files are given, the document is read
from standard input.  Each found phrase is enclosed in \fB[ ]\fP
(brackets).  Suggestions and advice, if any, are printed headed by a
right arrow \fB->\fP.
A sentence is a sequence of words, that starts with a capitalised word and
ends with a full stop, double colon, question mark or exclaimation mark.
A single letter followed by a dot is considered an abbreviation, so it
does not terminate a sentence.  Various multi-letter abbreviations are
recognized, they do not terminate a sentence as well.
.PP
\fBDiction\fP understands \fIcpp\fP(1) \fB#line\fP lines for being able to
give precise locations when printing sentences.

enforcing a call to deroff.
