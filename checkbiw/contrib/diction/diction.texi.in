@c {{{ Introduction
@node Introduction 
@chapter Introduction

@command{diction} finds all sentences in a document, that contain
phrases from a database of frequently misused, bad or wordy diction.
It further checks for double words.  If no files are given, the document
is read from standard input.  Each found phrase is enclosed in @code{[ ]}
(brackets).  Suggestions and advice, if any, are printed headed by a right
arrow @code{->}.  A sentence is a sequence of words, that starts with a
capitalised word and ends with a full stop, double colon, question mark
or exclaimation mark.  A single letter followed by a dot is considered an
abbreviation, so it does not terminate a sentence.  Various multi-letter
abbreviations are recognized, they do not terminate a sentence as well.

@command{diction} understands @command{cpp} @code{#line} lines for being
able to give precise locations when printing sentences.

There has been a diction command on old UNIX systems, which is now part
of the AT&T DWB package.  The original version was bound to roff by
enforcing a call to @command{deroff}.  This version is a reimplementation
and not must run in a pipe with @command{deroff} if you want to process
roff documents.  Similarly, you can run it in a pipe with @command{dehtml}
or @command{detex} to process HTML or TeX documents.

This variable specifies the @code{LC_MESSAGES} locale, which determines
the language that @command{diction} uses for messages.  American English
is used if the environment variable is not set, or if the message catalog
is not installed, or if @command{diction} was not compiled with national
language support (@sc{nls}).  The variable is further used as default
for the phrase language.
