The following things have been changed compared to version 1.02:

o  makefile bug fixed
o  No default prefix of /usr on Linux (confuses packaging systems
   when updating diction from source and a package was installed
   before)
o  Migration from catgets to GNU gettext inspired by patches from
   Jochen Hein
o  Diction loads phrase file for current locale by default, switching
   to locale C if there is no phrase file
