.SH DESCRIPTION \"{{{
\fBStyle\fP analyses the surface characteristics of the writing style
of a document.  It prints various readability grades, length of words,
sentences and paragraphs.
.\" sentence structure, word usage, verb type, sentence openers
It can further locate sentences with certain characteristics.
If no files are given, the document is read from standard input.
.PP
Numbers are counted as words with one syllable.
A sentence is a sequence of words, that starts with a capitalised word and
ends with a full stop, double colon, question mark or exclamation mark.
A single letter followed by a dot is considered an abbreviation, so it
does not end a sentence.  Various multi-letter abbreviations are
recognized, they do not end a sentence as well.
A paragraph
consists of two or more new line characters.
.SS "Readability grades"
\fBStyle\fP understands \fIcpp\fP(1) \fB#line\fP lines for being able to
give precise locations when printing sentences.
.IP "Kincaid formula" \"{{{ 
The Kincaid Formula has been developed for Navy training manuals, that
ranged in difficulty from 5.5 to 16.3.  It is probably best applied
to technical documents, because it is based on adult training manuals
rather than school book text.  Dialogs (often found in fictional texts)
are usually a series of short sentences, which lowers the score.  On the
other hand, scientific texts with many long scientific terms are rated
higher, although they are not necessarily harder to read for people
who are familiar with those terms.

.IP "Flesh reading easy formula" \"{{{ 
The Flesh reading easy formula has been developed by Flesh in 1948 and
it is based on school text covering grade 3 to 12.  It is wide spread,
especially in the USA, because of good results and simple computation.
The index is usually between 0 (hard) and 100 (easy), standard English
documents averages approximately 60 to 70.  Applying it to German
documents does not deliver good results because of the different language
structure.

.IP "Fog Index" \"{{{
The Fog index has been developed by Robert Gunning.  Its value is a
school grade.  The ``ideal'' Fog Index level is 7 or 8.  A level above
12 indicates the writing sample is too hard for most people to read.
Only use it on texts of at least hundred words to get meaningful results.
Note that a correct implementation would not count words of three or
more syllables that are proper names, combinations of easy words, or
made three syllables by suffixes such as \(ened, \(enes, or \(ening.

.SS "Word usage"
The word usage counts are intended to help identify excessive use of particular
parts of speech.
.IP "Verb Phrases" \"{{{
The category of verbs labeled "to be" identifies phrases using the passive
voice.  Use the passive voice sparingly, in favor of more direct verb forms.
The flag \fB-p\fP causes \fBstyle\fP to list all occurrences of the passive
voice.
.PP
The verb category "aux" measures the use of modal auxiliary verbs, such as
"can", "could", and "should".  Modal auxiliary verbs modify the mood of a verb.
.\"}}}
.IP "Conjunctions" \"{{{
The conjunctions counted by style are coordinating and subordinating.
Coordinating conjunctions join grammatically equal sentence fragments, such as
a noun with a noun, a phrase with a phrase, or a clause to a clause.
Coordinating conjunctions are "and," "but," "or," "yet," and "nor."
.PP
Subordinating conjunctions connect clauses of unequal status.  A subordinating
conjunction links a subordinate clause, which is unable to stand alone, to an
independent clause.  Examples of subordinating conjunctions are "because,"
"although," and "even if."
.\"}}}
.IP "Pronouns" \"{{{
Pronouns are contextual references to nouns and noun phrases.  Documents with
few pronouns generally lack cohesiveness and fluidity.  Too many pronouns may
indicate ambiguity.
.\"}}}
.IP "Nominalizations" \"{{{
Nominalizations are verbs that are changed to nouns.  Style recognizes words
that end in "ment," "ance," "ence," or "ion" as nominalizations.
Examples are "endowment," "admittance," and "nominalization."  Too much
nominalization in a document can sound abstract and be difficult to understand.
The flag \fB-N\fP causes \fBstyle\fP to list all nominalizations.  The
flag \fB-n\fP prints all sentences with either the passive voice or a
nominalization.
