 The tech-paper writer's ultimate BUGS in Writing must-read list

 Michael Hohmuth

Why you should read this document
#################################

You are writing a paper, perhaps for a technical conference or another
tech-savvy audience?  You want others to read your material, not
stumble over your writing bugs?  You are a German?  

Then you must read the Book BUGS in Writing [BugsInWriting].  All of it.
This book teaches you good style and helps you avoid many of the most
common writing errors.

But if you are in a hurry, then before you read the book, read this
document.  It lists the (in my mind) most important subjects related
to the most common and worst writing errors, which everybody seems to
get wrong all the time.

Assumptions
===========

I assume that you are writing in American English.


The most important orthography, grammar, and style rules
########################################################

The following subsections are (mostly) named like their counterparts
in BUGS in Writing.  To find them in the book, use the book's Index of
Principles on pages 635ff.

Passive Voice; you and your reader (§1, §2)
===========================================

Avoid passive voice.  Mention the agent of an action as the sentence's
subject.  Bad: ``The capability is revoked when it times out.''  Who
revokes the capability?  Better: ``When the capability times out, the
kernel automatically revokes it.''

An especially bad excuse for not using active voice is to avoid
referring to yourself as ``I'' or ``we.''  Do not refer to yourself as
``the author''; do not call your audience ``the reader.'' Avoid using
``one''; as in ``One can only wonder who writes sentences as ugly as
this one.''

Address your reader as ``you.''  When guiding the reader through your
document or through a difficult problem, you can also use ``we.''
When giving instructions, you can avoid pronouns altogether without
resorting to passive voice, as in: ``Avoid passive voice.''

Hyphens (§29)
=============

Use hyphens in compound adjectives, as in ``microkernel-based
system,'' except if the adjective follows the term, as in ``the system
is microkernel based.''

There is no hyphen between adjectives (compound or not) and compound
nouns, as in ``microkernel operating system.''

Which versus That (§17)
=======================

Use ``that'' when identifying single objects or persons, as in ``the
button that says `start'.''  Use ``which'' when conveying extra
information about an object that already has been identified: ``Emacs,
which is the best editor program of the world, has a working set of
eight megabytes.''

There is a comma in front of ``which,'' but never before ``that.''

Enumerations, And, semicolons, and commas (§23, §26)
====================================================

When enumerating items in a list, separate the items with commas or,
if the list items contain commas themselves, with semicolons.  Put a
comma in front of the final item's ``and'' or ``or'' as well.  The
only exception is a list that contains only two items---in this case,
no comma is necessary.

I.e., E.g., Etc., and Et al. (§21)
==================================

Use the Latin abbreviations ``i.e.'' (_id est_), ``e.g.'' 
(_exempli gratia_), ``etc.'' (_et cetera_), and ``et al.'' (_et alii_)
only when writing for an academic audience, and only inside
parentheses.  In regular text use ``that is,'' ``for example,'' 
``and so on,'' and ``and colleagues,'' ``and associates,'' or ``and
coworkers.''

Do not set these abbreviations in italic type; use roman type.

Undefined This (§8)
===================

Always use a noun after words such as ``this,'' ``these'', ``that,''
and ``some.''  Leaving a ``this'' dangling in the air results in
information loss: _What_ exactly was it the ``this'' is referring to?

Either and Both, Neither and Nor (§28, §99)
===========================================

Word before ``either'' and ``both'' apply to both alternatives, words
placed after ``either'' and ``both'' apply to only one.

Use ``nor'' (instead of ``or'') with ``neither.''  Again, word order
matters: Place words that apply to both alternatives outside the
neither--nor phrase.

Note that there is no comma after ``both'' and ``neither.''

Cannot versus Can Not (§104)
============================

The negation of ``can'' is ``cannot.''  Use ``can not'' only if
someone is able of not doing something, as in ``I can not snore.''

Abbreviations (§21)
===================

Always define abbreviations on first use, as in: ``...the Dresden
Real-Time Operating System (DROPS).  DROPS provides support for...''

Remember that both the abstract and the main document count as
separate documents.  Therefore, you need to introduce abbreviations in
both of these documents.

Sections and Figures (§62)
==========================

When referring to sections, figures, and the like by number, the word
preceding the number must be capitalized, as in 
``Section [Sections and Figures (§62)].''

Citations (§65)
===============

Use regular citations (the ones using square brackets) only for
published material.  When referring to unpublished or
aurally-transmitted material, use footnotes instead.

Put a space in front of the opening bracket of your citation.  You
can automate this task in LaTeX using:
!  \usepackage{cite}

The list of cited bibliographic references is called ``References,''
not ``Bibliography''; the latter is a list of works that may or may
not relate to a given text.

Rewords, Nonwords (§106, §134)
==============================

Set rewords and nonwords---that is, words beginning with ``re'' or
with ``non''---as single, unhyphenated words.  The exception are
nonwords in which the second term consists of multiple words or begins
with a capital letter (as in names).

:Examples: reestimate, reentry, reevaluate, rerelease, nonmonotonic,
  nontrivial, nonnuclear

:Exceptions: re-sent (to avoid confusion with resent), non-Unix,
  non-real-time system, non-Monte Carlo methods

Em dashes and en dashes (§49, §77)
==================================

There are three kinds of dashes: hyphens ("-"; LaTeX: '-'), en dashes
("--"; in roman script, it is as wide as the letter "n"; LaTeX: '--'),
and em dashes ("---"; as wide as "m"; LaTeX: '---').

Use hyphens to connect the terms in compound adjectives (see Section
[Hyphens (§29)]).  LaTeX also uses it for hyphenation at the end of a line.

Use en dashes in word pairs, such as ``input--output system'' (avoid
writing ``input/output system'').

Use em dashes for bracketing tangential thoughts.  Using em dashes
highlights tangential material, whereas parentheses "()" downplays it.
Note that there should not be whitespace next to em dashes---as in
this example---because the em dash already provides enough separation.
Em dashes are an excellent way to highlight clauses beginning with
``that is'' or ``for example.''

Quotation marks and quotations (§35, §41)
=========================================

Use quotation marks only for quotations and for marking irony.  Do not
use quotation marks when introducing new terms; use _italic type_ in
that case.

In American English, commas and periods (but not semicolons or other
punctuation) that would normally come after a quotation move into the
quotation, ``as in this example.''  The exception to this rule is text
for which a literal quotation is important---for example, for text
that is intended to be typed into the reader's computer.

(In British English and every other English dialect, commas and
periods belong outside the quotation marks.)

Solidus (slash) and word pairs (§117)
=====================================

The forward slash (``/'') is an abbreviation for ``and or.''  

Generally, you should avoid using the slash.  When you mean ``and
or,'' you usually can get away with just ``and.''

Do not use the slash to denote word pairs.  Instead, use the en dash,
as in ``input--output system,'' ``doctor--patient relationship''  (see
Section [Em dashes and en dashes (§49, §77)]).

Cap/lc: Capitalized section headings (§83)
==========================================

The style in which section headings and captions are capitalized in a
funny way is called _Cap/lc_.  There are very precise rules on what to
capitalize when using this style, and these rules are easy to get
wrong or forget.  Therefore, I suggest you do _not_ use this style for
your headings and captions.

If you really must use Cap/lc, look up the rules in [BugsInWriting],
Segment 83.

Like versus Such As (§27)
=========================

Use ``such as'' to select examples of a group.  Use ``like'' only for
likeness, that is, when something resembles something else.

Phrases to avoid
================

:as to whether (§50):
  Use ``whether.'' 

:different than (§61):
  Use ``different from.''

:is due to (§39):
  Do not use this phrase when you mean ``is caused by'' or ``was
  developed, written, invented, coined by.'' Instead, use phrases like
  ``stems from'' and ``originates in.''  Use ``is due to'' only when
  indicating reparations.

:above and below (§48):
  Do not use these terms when referring to other sections or parts of
  your document.  Instead, use phrases like ``Section 3,'' ``previous
  section'' and ``next section.''

:all of (§108):
  Just ``all'' suffices.

:contractions (it's OK...) (§32):
  Do not use contractions such as ``it's'', ``he's'', ``haven't,'' or
  ``OK'' in formal writing.  Always expand these terms.

:is comprised of (§75):
  The whole is not ``comprised of'' the parts; instead, the whole
  comprises the parts.  (Also, the parts constitute or make up the
  whole.)

:around (§90):
  Use ``around'' only when referring to the surroundings of
  something.  When giving imprecise numbers, use phrases like
  ``approximately,'' ``more or less,'' ``about,'' or ``roughly.''

:effort (§16):
  Use effort only when describing physical activity such as climbing a
  hill.  In formal writing, you should avoid this cliché term.

:equals (§57):
  The correct wording is ``is equal to.''

:impact (§25):
  Use impact only for physical encounters.  Do not use this word when
  you mean ``influence'' or ``effect.''

:issue (§111):
  This is another cliché term you should avoid.  Instead, state
  clearly and precisely what you actually mean---maybe a problem or a
  requirement?

:the reason is because (§55):
  Use just ``because'' or ``the reason is.''

:the fact that (§66):
  Use just ``that'' or leave out the phrase.

:though (§52):
  Use ``although.''

:utilize (§109):
  Normally, just ``use'' suffices.  Use ``utilize'' only when
  activating something that is usually not used.
