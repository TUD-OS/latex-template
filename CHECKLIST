* Dashes

The single minus —the hyphen— appears within words; use the double
minus — the en-dash — in number ranges; and use the treble dash, or
em-dash, as in the previous clauses here.

* Headings

In section headings, capitalize all words except closed class words
(i.e., prepositions, conjuctions, and so on).

in subsection headings and below, only capitalize the first word and
any proper names.

* Structure

Tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them it, then tell them
you've told them it.

* Footnotes

Don't put a space before a \footnote command. Put the footnote after
the punctuation mark it is next to, not before it.

Make sure you include a full stop at the end of the footnote text. And
make sure your footnotes are complete sentences.
